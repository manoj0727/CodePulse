# Codeforces API CORS Solution

## The Problem
The Codeforces API doesn't include CORS headers, which prevents direct API calls from web browsers due to the Same-Origin Policy.

## Solution Implemented
I've implemented a robust CORS proxy solution that:

1. **Uses multiple CORS proxy services** as fallbacks
2. **Provides detailed console logging** for debugging
3. **Handles errors gracefully** with user-friendly messages

## How It Works

### 1. CORS Proxy Service (`src/services/corsProxies.js`)
- Tries multiple public CORS proxy services in sequence
- Falls back to the next proxy if one fails
- Provides detailed error logging

### 2. Updated API Service (`src/services/api.js`)
- Uses the `fetchWithCORS` helper function
- Includes comprehensive console logging
- Better error handling and user feedback

## Testing the Solution

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open the browser console** (F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console)

3. **Try analyzing a Codeforces handle:**
   - Select "Codeforces Only" or "Complete Analysis"
   - Enter a valid handle (e.g., "tourist", "Benq", "SecondThread")
   - Click "Analyze"

4. **Check the console for:**
   - API call logs
   - Success/failure messages
   - Detailed error information if something fails

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Backend Proxy Server (Recommended for Production)
Create a backend server that acts as a proxy:

```javascript
// backend/server.js
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const axios = require('axios');

const app = express();
app.use(cors());

app.get('/api/codeforces/*', async (req, res) => {
  const endpoint = req.params[0];
  const query = req.query;
  
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(
      `https://codeforces.com/api/${endpoint}`,
      { params: query }
    );
    res.json(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});

app.listen(3001);
```

### Option 2: Browser Extension
For development, you can use browser extensions like:
- "CORS Unblock" for Chrome
- "CORS Everywhere" for Firefox

**Note:** Only use these for development, never in production.

## Troubleshooting

1. **If all proxies fail:**
   - Check if the Codeforces API is down
   - Try a different handle to ensure it's not a user-specific issue
   - Consider implementing your own backend proxy

2. **Rate limiting:**
   - Some CORS proxies have rate limits
   - If you hit limits, wait a few minutes or switch to a backend proxy

3. **Network issues:**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Try accessing https://codeforces.com directly
   - Check if the proxy services are accessible

## Console Output Examples

### Successful API Call:
```
Fetching Codeforces data for handle: tourist
Trying proxy: https://corsproxy.io/?
Fetching user info...
Successfully fetched data using proxy: https://corsproxy.io/?
User data received: {status: "OK", result: [...]}
Fetching rating history...
Rating data received: OK
Fetching submissions...
Submissions data received: OK Count: 500
```

### Failed API Call:
```
Fetching Codeforces data for handle: invaliduser123
Trying proxy: https://corsproxy.io/?
Failed with proxy https://corsproxy.io/?: HTTP 400: Bad Request
Trying proxy: https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=
...
Error in fetchCodeforcesData: Codeforces user not found
```

## Next Steps

For production deployment, implement a proper backend proxy server to:
- Avoid dependency on third-party CORS proxies
- Improve reliability and performance
- Add caching to reduce API calls
- Implement rate limiting and monitoring
